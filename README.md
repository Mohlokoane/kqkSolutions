KQK Solutions is a responsive micro-lending website developed to support a financial services company that provides fast, transparent, and affordable short-term loans to individuals. The platform is designed to simplify the loan application process while ensuring clarity, accessibility, and compliance with basic financial service standards.

The website enables users to submit loan applications online through a structured form that captures essential client information such as personal details, contact information, loan amount, and reason for the loan. Form submissions are securely handled using Formspree, allowing applications to be delivered directly to the company’s email inbox, with automatic confirmation messaging to enhance user trust and experience.

The project focuses strongly on mobile-first design, ensuring that the website performs seamlessly across smartphones, tablets, and desktops. The user interface is clean and intuitive, with clear calls to action, simple navigation, and readable content optimized for end users who may have limited technical experience.

In addition to core functionality, the website includes Terms and Conditions and a Privacy Policy section to support transparency and responsible handling of user information. The site is deployed on Netlify, providing fast load times, HTTPS security, and easy continuous deployment through GitHub integration.

This project demonstrates practical front-end development skills, including responsive layout design, form handling, third-party service integration, deployment workflows, and real-world business application development.
